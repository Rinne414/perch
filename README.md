# Perch

A local-first Windows desktop reminder for people who run AI coding agents.

A small glass window perches on your desktop and shows only what needs you **now**: agents that finished or are waiting for your answer, today's work with its next step, and routines you have not done for a while. A main window keeps the rest — the inbox, what comes later, routines and their history.

> Early version (0.1), Windows only. The interface is in Traditional Chinese.

## What it does

- **Agents come back to you.** Hooks for Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build and OpenCode report when a session finishes, fails or waits for input. You get a notification, and the session stays in the float until you mark it seen. A **回去** button copies the command that reopens that session in its folder.
- **Capture without friction.** `Ctrl+Alt+N` anywhere opens a one-line box. Dates are read from what you type, in Chinese or English: `明天下午3點 交報告`, `週五`, `10/2 17:00`.
- **Start instead of finish.** Break a task into small steps; the float shows the next one. **先做 5 分鐘** starts a five-minute timer on it — no pop-up when it ends, no failure state.
- **Honest but gentle.** Overdue work is shown as it is, with calm ways out: move it, take the date away, or **不做了** (let it go without deleting it).
- **"When did I last…?"** Routines either have a goal ("every 3 days", the float reminds you) or only remember the last time (never nags). Each one keeps its history; you can record a time after the fact ("昨天", "前天晚上").
- **Nothing leaves your computer.** No account, no server, no network port.

## Install

There is no signed release yet. Build the installer yourself (see below) and run `dist/Perch-Setup-<version>.exe`. Windows may warn about an unknown publisher on a downloaded copy: choose **More info → Run anyway**.

The app starts with Windows if you turn on 設定 → 開機時啟動.

### Connect your agents

Open the main window (tray menu → 開啟主視窗) → **設定**, then press **安裝** next to each agent.

- This edits the agent's own config (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, …) and keeps a backup next to it as `*.perch.bak`. **移除** takes our entries out again and leaves everything else as it was.
- The hooks run `node`, so [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or newer must be on your `PATH` (OpenCode uses a plugin and does not need it).
- **Codex** only runs hooks you trust: after installing, run `/hooks` inside Codex once and trust `perch`.
- Gemini CLI can be installed but has not been verified yet.

### Other agents

Anything can report to Perch by writing a JSON file into the inbox folder (`%APPDATA%\Perch\inbox`). The format is public and versioned — see [`src/shared/agentEvent.ts`](src/shared/agentEvent.ts):

```json
{ "v": 1, "agent": "my-agent", "sessionId": "abc123", "status": "done", "cwd": "C:\\code\\app", "title": "fix the login page" }
```

`status` is one of `running`, `needs_input`, `done`, `failed`, `cancelled`. Write to a temporary name first and rename it to `*.json`, so the app never reads half a file.

## Your data

Everything lives in `%APPDATA%\Perch`: a SQLite database (`tasks.db`) and the agent inbox. From an agent report Perch keeps the status, the project folder, the first line of your prompt as a title, and one line of detail (the agent's last reply, what it is waiting for, or the error). 設定 → 按來源清除資料 deletes everything one agent wrote.

## Build from source

Requires Node.js 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test            # unit tests
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build       # then: node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe .
pnpm run dist        # Windows installer in dist/
```

If `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe` is missing after install, run `node node_modules/electron/install.js`.

Development switches (ignored by an installed copy):

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TC_DATA_DIR=<folder>` | Use a throwaway data folder instead of `.data/` |
| `TC_AGENT_HOME=<folder>` | Hook install / remove edits a fake home folder, never your real agent configs |
| `TC_SEED=1` | Fill an empty database with sample data |
| `TC_SCREENSHOT=<file.png>` | Grab the window from the screen once rendered, print its text, and quit |
| `TC_SCREENSHOT_VIEW=float\|main\|capture`, `TC_SCREENSHOT_TAB=inbox` | Which window and tab to capture |
| `TC_SCREENSHOT_JS=<script>` | Run a script in the page first (clicks, typing) |
| `TC_SCREENSHOT_BACKDROP=1` | Put a neutral wallpaper behind the glass |

Why it works the way it does — what was borrowed from Todoist, TickTick, Sunsama, Amazing Marvin, Goblin Tools, Last Time, Super Productivity, Hindsight and Claude Code's Agent View, and what was left out on purpose — is in [`docs/reference-apps.md`](docs/reference-apps.md).

## 中文說明

Perch 是給同時跑好幾個 AI agent 的人用的桌面提醒工具，所有資料都只存在自己的電腦裡。

- 浮窗只顯示「現在」要處理的事：跑完或在等你回覆的 agent、今天的事和下一步、太久沒做的例行事項。
- 在任何地方按 `Ctrl+Alt+N` 就能記下一件事，日期可以直接用中文寫：「明天下午3點 交報告」。
- 主視窗有收件匣、之後的事、例行事項和每次紀錄，還有設定頁可以一鍵把 hook 裝進 Claude Code、Codex、Grok Build、OpenCode。
- 不會催你、不算連續天數；做不到的事可以「不做了」，紀錄還會留著。

安裝方式、連接 agent 的步驟和資料位置請看上面的英文說明。
